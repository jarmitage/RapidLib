## C++ Library
RapidLib is a lightweight library for interactive machine learning, inspired by [Wekinator](http://www.wekinator.org/).

It currently features classification (using kNN), regression (multilayer perceptron), and series classification (using dynamic time warping).   

**[Full C++ documentation can be found here](https://mzed.github.io/RapidLib/doxygen/annotated.html).**

## Javascript   
RapidLib has also been transpiled to JavaScript using Emscripten. It can be used in a browser through a script tag.
```
<script src="https://www.doc.gold.ac.uk/eavi/rapidmix/RapidLib.js"></script>
```
It can also be used in Node.js via npm:
```javascript
npm install rapidlib
```
